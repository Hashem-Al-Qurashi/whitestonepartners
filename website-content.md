## ABOUT US PAGE

### Our Story
"Whitestone Partners was founded in 2025 by technology leaders Hashem Hanafy and Alaa Badran, who recognized a critical gap in the market: the disconnect between powerful emerging technologies and practical business implementation.

With over 20 years of combined experience in enterprise technology solutions, our founders witnessed countless organizations struggle to translate technological potential into tangible business results. Traditional consulting firms offered strategies without execution, while development shops provided code without context.

Whitestone Partners bridges this gap. We're the technology partner that understands both the boardroom and the server room, delivering solutions that satisfy both CFOs and CTOs."

### Our Mission
"To democratize access to enterprise-grade AI and emerging technologies, enabling organizations of all sizes to compete in the digital-first economy through intelligent automation, data-driven insights, and innovative software solutions."

### Our Values

**Innovation-First Mindset**
We don't just follow trends—we anticipate them. Our team continuously explores emerging technologies like generative AI, quantum computing, and edge computing to keep our clients ahead of disruption.

**Security-By-Design**
Every solution we build incorporates enterprise-grade security from conception to deployment. We're ISO 27001 certified and maintain the highest standards for data protection and compliance.

**Measurable Outcomes**
We're not satisfied with technology for technology's sake. Every project includes clear KPIs, ROI tracking, and business impact measurement to ensure our solutions deliver quantifiable value.

**Partnership Approach**
We don't just deliver projects—we build lasting relationships. Our clients become partners, and their success becomes our success through ongoing optimization and strategic guidance.
